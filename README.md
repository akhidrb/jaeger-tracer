## **Jaeger: open source, end-to-end distributed tracing**

**Monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems**

Why Jaeger?
As on-the-ground microservice practitioners are quickly realizing, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in two areas: networking and observability. It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.
